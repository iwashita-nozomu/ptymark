## Review Focus

- Comparison fairness
- Metric validity
- Quantitative summary quality
- Report structure quality
- Whether abstract states the main finding with numbers
- Whether Results and Discussion are properly separated
- Whether figures/tables are interpretable without surrounding prose
- Whether axes, units, and linear/log scale are explicitly labeled
- Whether conclusions cite the figures/tables that support them
- Whether the sweep is contiguous along ordered difficulty axes unless justified
- Whether the same case set was compared
- Whether failures were hidden by aggregation
- Overclaim risk
- Restart-or-rerun judgement
- Next change justification

## Critical Questions

- Are the conclusions driven only by averages?
- Are success rate and failure kinds reported next to the headline metric?
- Is the baseline comparison on the same cases and conditions?
- Does the abstract actually state the main result and its scope?
- Does the Results section report observations before explanations?
- Does the Discussion introduce new evidence that had to be placed in Results?
- Are axis names, units, and linear/log scale explicit on every key figure?
- Does each major conclusion point to a supporting figure or table?
- Was the dimension / level sweep contiguous, and if not, was the exception justified?
- Is the interpretation supported by the observed data, or is it speculative?
- What evidence is still missing before the next code change or claim?
