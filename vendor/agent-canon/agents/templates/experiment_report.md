## Reader Map

This template owns the structure of a single experiment report. Fill the
question, protocol, results, interpretation, limitations, reproducibility
record, artifacts, and critical review in that order, while writing the
abstract last. Use it for run-scoped empirical evidence; do not use it as the
place to promote durable policy, workflow changes, or unsupported conclusions.

## Abstract

<!-- Write last. 4-7 sentences with question, protocol, strongest result with numbers, meaning, and limitation. -->

## Question and Context

### Question

<!-- What empirical question did this run address? -->

### Formulation

<!-- Mathematical / algorithmic setup in words. -->

### Comparison Target

<!-- main, baseline, prior method, or external reference. -->

### Metrics

<!-- Accuracy, time, memory, failure rate, robustness, etc. -->

## Protocol

### Command

<!-- Exact command or script entry point. -->

### Environment

<!-- Branch, commit, worktree, hardware, software versions, timeout, seeds. -->

### Fairness Notes

<!-- Same case set, same hardware, same timeout, same dtype policy, etc. -->

## Results

### Quantitative Summary

<!-- Case count, success rate, failure kinds, representative metrics, variability. -->

### Comparison Table

<!-- Same-case comparison against baseline/main/reference. -->

### Main Trends

<!-- Report the main observed findings first, with concrete numbers. -->

### Exceptions and Failures

<!-- Unexpected outcomes, unstable regions, and failure patterns. -->

### Figures

<!-- Each figure must state axis names, units, linear/log scale, and at least one sentence on how to read it. -->

## Discussion

### Supported Interpretation

<!-- What the observed results support. -->

### Comparison with Baseline or Prior Work

<!-- How these findings relate to main / baseline / literature. -->

### Speculative Interpretation

<!-- Possible explanations that still need more evidence. -->

## Conclusion

<!-- State the final takeaways and cite the supporting figure/table for each major claim. -->

## Limitations

<!-- Scope limits, sample size limits, hardware dependence, comparison gaps. -->

## Reproducibility Record

<!-- Commit, exact command, environment, final JSON, raw JSONL, renderer / plot command. -->

## Artifacts and Carry-Over

<!-- Which outputs remain as run artifacts in main and which results are promoted into durable docs, notes, or summaries. -->

## Critical Review

### Overclaim Risk

<!-- What this report does not yet justify saying. -->

### Missing Evidence

<!-- What still needs to be run or compared. -->

### Alternative Explanation

<!-- Plausible competing interpretations. -->

### Next Check

<!-- The next concrete experiment or code change justified by this report. -->
