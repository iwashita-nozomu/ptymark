## Scope

<!-- Record the run bundle evaluated and whether the evidence came from workflow_monitoring.md, traces, run artifacts, review artifacts, validation logs, or user feedback. -->

## Rubric

| Criterion | Score | Max | Status | Feedback |
| --------- | ----- | --- | ------ | -------- |

## Feedback Actions

| Action ID | Severity | Action | Status |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |

## Learning Capture

<!-- Record whether durable agent-side observations should be logged with tools/agent_tools/log_agent_learning.py, and whether any skill/config/workflow change was applied or explicitly not_applicable. Do not paste raw chat. If runtime feedback was observed and action was not no_op, cite the applied or recorded improvement decision and its concrete target. -->
