## Reader Map

- This template owns the expected structure for a topic-first experiment report
  note.
- Follow the section path from abstract, question and context, protocol, results,
  discussion, conclusion, limitations, reproducibility, artifacts, and critical
  review.
- Use it when drafting a concise experiment report that must preserve protocol,
  result, limitation, and carry-over evidence.
- The template is a report scaffold; it does not define experiment runner
  behavior or replace the experiment registry contract.


## Abstract

<!-- Write this last. 4-7 sentences: question, protocol, strongest result with numbers, meaning, limitation. -->

## Question and Context

### Question

<!-- What empirical question is this report answering? -->

### Formulation

<!-- Mathematical / algorithmic setup in words. -->

### Comparison Target

<!-- main, baseline, prior method, or external reference. -->

### Metrics

<!-- Accuracy, time, memory, failure rate, robustness, etc. -->

## Protocol

### Command

<!-- Exact command or script entry point. -->

### Environment

<!-- Commit, optional branch, hardware, software versions, timeout, seeds. -->

### Fairness Notes

<!-- Same case set, same hardware, same timeout, same dtype policy, etc. -->

## Results

### Quantitative Summary

<!-- Case count, success rate, failure kinds, representative metrics, variability. -->

### Comparison Table

<!-- Exact or compact table comparing the same case set across methods. -->

### Main Trends

<!-- Report the main observed findings first, with concrete numbers. -->

### Exceptions and Failures

<!-- Unexpected outcomes, unstable regions, and failure patterns. -->

### Figures

<!-- Each figure should state axis names, units, linear/log scale, and at least one sentence on how to read it. -->

## Discussion

### Supported Interpretation

<!-- What the observed results support. -->

### Comparison with Baseline or Prior Work

<!-- How these findings relate to main / baseline / literature. -->

### Speculative Interpretation

<!-- Possible explanations that still need more evidence. -->

## Conclusion

<!-- State the final takeaways and cite the supporting figure/table for each major claim. -->

## Limitations

<!-- Scope limits, sample size limits, hardware dependence, comparison gaps. -->

## Reproducibility Record

- Branch:
- Commit:
- Worktree:
- Final JSON:
- Raw JSONL:
- Renderer / plot command:

## Artifacts and Carry-Over

<!-- Which outputs stay in the run directory and which artifacts are carried back to main. -->

## Critical Review

### Overclaim Risk

<!-- What this report does not yet justify saying. -->

### Missing Evidence

<!-- What still needs to be run or compared. -->

### Alternative Explanation

<!-- Plausible competing interpretations. -->

### Next Check

<!-- The next concrete experiment or code change justified by this report. -->
